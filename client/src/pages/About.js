                Our name, “StreetStyle” is an amalgamation of two complete
                opposite words. At its core, it represents the coming together
                of different perspectives or tastes bound together by the love
                for sneakers & street culture. As a community-first sneaker and
                streetwear boutique in India, we aim to be zeitgeists. With our
                culture-to-commerce approach, we endeavour to be at the
                forefront of movements rooted in music, art, fashion and more.
                Through our platform and reach, we champion inclusivity,
                individuality and creative expression. Collaborating with
                creators from all over India and across the world, we create
                impactful stories and editorial content. The design of our
                apparel collections pays respect to the culture we come from.
                This collision of tradition and contemporary silhouettes speaks
                to our intention of being a streetwear brand from India -
                connected to our roots, relevant in the now, but creating the
                future. Since our inception in 2016, we’ve evolved from a
                sneaker boutique and streetwear brand to become a cultural force
                that cultivates and shapes both sneakers and pop culture.
