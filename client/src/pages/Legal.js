                TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO USERS
            </h3>
            <p className="leading-loose p-4">
                1.1 Users must be 18 years of age or older to register, or visit
                or use the Services in any manner. By registering, visiting or
                using the Services, you hereby represent and warrant to
                VegnonVeg that you are 18 years of age or older, and that you
                have the right, authority and capacity to use the Services, and
                agree to abide by the Agreement. If a User is below 18 years of
                age, it is assumed that he/ she is using/ browsing the Platforms
                under the supervision of his/ her parent or legal guardian and
                that such User’s parent or legal guardian has read and agrees to
                the terms of this Agreement, including terms of purchase of
                Products, on behalf of the minor User. Should VegnonVeg be made
                aware that a User is under the age of 18 and is using/ browsing
                the Platforms without the supervision of his/ her parent or
                legal guardian, VegnonVeg reserves the right to deactivate such
                User’s account without further notice. 1.2 The contents of
                Services, information, text, graphics, images, logos, button
                icons, software code, interface, design and the collection,
                arrangement and assembly of the content on the Platforms or any
                of the other Services are the property of VegnonVeg, its parent
                company, group companies, subsidiaries, associates, affiliates,
                suppliers, vendors and sister companies, as the case may be
                (“VegnonVeg Content”), and are protected under copyright,
                trademark and other applicable laws. You shall not modify the
                VegnonVeg Content or reproduce, display, publicly perform,
                distribute, reverse engineer or otherwise use the VegnonVeg
                Content in any way for any public or commercial purpose or for
                personal gain. 1.3 VegnonVeg authorises you to view and access
                the VegnonVeg Content solely for identifying Products, carrying
                out purchases of Products and processing returns and refunds, in
                accordance with Return and Refund Policy, if any. VegnonVeg,
                therefore, grants you a limited, revocable permission to access
                and use the Services. This permission does not include a
                permission for carrying out any resale of the Products or
                commercial use of the VegnonVeg Content, any collection and use
                of product listings, description, or prices, and, any derivative
                use of the Platforms or of VegnonVeg Content. 1.4 You agree to
                maintain and promptly update all data provided by you and to
                keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any
                information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, incomplete,
                or if VegnonVeg has reasonable grounds to suspect that the
                information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current,
                incomplete, or not in accordance with the terms of the
                Agreement, VegnonVeg reserves the right to indefinitely suspend,
                terminate or block your access to the Platforms, and refuse to
                provide you with access to the Platforms in future. 1.5 You
                understand that on your registration as a User or on your
                purchase of Products on the Platforms, you may receive text
                messages and/or emails from VegnonVeg on your registered mobile
                number and/or email address. These messages and/or emails could
                relate inter alia to your registration, VegnonVeg’s acceptance
                or rejection of your offer to purchase a Product, payment
                information, Product despatch information, information
                pertaining to other activities you carry out on the Platforms
                and information pertaining to the promotions that are undertaken
                by VegnonVeg (or third parties in connection with the Platforms)
                from time to time. It is specifically clarified that a text
                message and/or an email confirming the receipt of your order is
                not an acceptance from VegnonVeg that the Product will be
                delivered. VegnonVeg’s acceptance to your offer to purchase
                shall occur and conclude only when the Products have been
                delivered by VegnonVeg and a text message and/or email
                confirming such delivery is visible on your tracking link.
                VegnonVeg, at all times, reserves the right to limit the
                quantity of items in, or cancel an order anytime before the
                delivery. 1.6 Any communication from VegnonVeg shall be sent
                only to your registered mobile number and/or email address or
                such other contact number or email address that you may
                designate, for any particular transaction. You shall be solely
                responsible to update your registered mobile number and/or email
                address on the Platforms in the event there is a change.
                Further, VegnonVeg may also send you notifications and reminders
                with respect to scheduled deliveries of the purchased Products.
                While VegnonVeg shall make every endeavour to share prompt
                reminders and notifications relating to the delivery of
                purchased Products with you, VegnonVeg shall not be held liable
                for any failure to send such notifications or reminders to you.
